Street light lamp:-  The LDR senses ambient light levels. During the day, the LDR's resistance is low, resulting in a higher voltage at the base of the transistor. This keeps the transistor in the off state, so the relay is not energized, and the street light remains off. At night, the LDR’s resistance increases, decreasing the voltage at the base of the transistor. This turns the transistor on, energizing the relay, which closes the circuit for the street light, turning it on.

Components Needed:-
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Resistor (e.g., 10kΩ)
NPN Transistor (e.g., BC547)
Relay module (5V)
Diode (e.g., 1N4007)
Capacitor (e.g., 10µF)
IC7805 (5V DC)
Street Light (e.g., LED bulb)
OP amp LM358N
